The cell branch quantizes the per-cell features that the MLP extracted
*before* any neighbourhood aggregation — so VQ_cell has no architectural
access to neighbours' information and is structurally biased to encode
cell-intrinsic signal (e.g. cell type).

The niche branch quantizes the post-aggregation features from the GNN, so
VQ_niche only sees signal that has been mixed with neighbours' features —
structurally biased to encode niche / spatial-context signal.

Both VQ slots accept any class registered in `get_vq_class` (single
`VectorQuantize`, hierarchical `ResidualVQ_Squint`, tree `ConditionalVQ`,
etc.).  The two slots have *independent* `vq_cell_params` and
`vq_niche_params` dicts so they can be configured separately.

The GNN consumes the **continuous** `z_mlp`, not `z_q_cell`.  Feeding the
GNN the discretised cell code would be a severe bottleneck (only K_cell
distinct inputs per cell) and would couple the two branches in a way that
breaks the architectural disentanglement.

        Parameters
        ----------
        in_channels: int
            Number of input gene features.
        mlp_params: dict, optional
            Args for the SHARED / cell-branch MLP trunk. None disables
            the MLP, in which case the cell-VQ sees raw `x` directly
            (uncommon). When `niche_mlp_params` is also provided, this
            MLP feeds the cell branch ONLY (the niche branch then has
            its own MLP — see below). When `niche_mlp_params is None`
            (legacy default), this MLP is shared between cell + niche
            paths (legacy "shared trunk" behaviour).
        niche_mlp_params: dict, optional
            When provided, builds a SEPARATE niche-side MLP trunk —
            architecturally independent from `mlp_params`. The niche
            path becomes `x -> MLP_niche -> z_mlp_niche -> [niche_neck]
            -> GNN -> ...`, and `z_mlp_niche`'s gradients (from the
            adjacency BCE, nbr-NB, niche-commit) flow ONLY through
            `MLP_niche.weight`, NOT through `MLP_cell.weight`. The
            cell-VQ input (z_mlp_cell, from `mlp_params`) is then
            completely shielded from spatial-loss gradients — useful
            when the cell codebook is being pulled away from cell-
            type-discriminative geometry by spatial pressure on the
            shared trunk.
            Default `None` -> niche shares the cell-side MLP (legacy).
            For full decoupling at the same encoder shape, pass a
            deep copy of `mlp_params`.
        gnn_name: 'SAGEConv' | 'GATv2Conv' | 'GINConv'
            GNN aggregator class for the niche branch.
        gnn_params: dict
            Args for the GNN (hidden_channels, num_layers, etc.).
        conditioning_params: dict
            Optional FiLM conditioning, applied to the GNN output (so it
            affects the niche branch only). Use `condition_list=...` to
            enable; missing key disables it. When `niche_mlp_params`
            is set AND the cell/niche MLP output dims differ, FiLM
            will fail with a dim mismatch — keep niche MLP output dim
            equal to cell MLP output dim if you also enable FiLM.
        vq_cell_params: dict
            VQ class + args for the *cell* branch. `vq_name` selects the
            class (default 'VectorQuantize'). Quantises `z_mlp`.
        vq_niche_params: dict
            VQ class + args for the *niche* branch. Quantises `z_gnn`.
        cross_stitch_params: dict, optional
            When provided, inserts a cross-stitch unit (Misra et al.
            2016) that learns a 2x2 mix of the cell- and niche-branch
            post-MLP latents before the cell-VQ / GNN split — the
            "soft sharing" coupling that spans shared-to-decoupled.
            Requires the DECOUPLED architecture (`niche_mlp_params`
            set) and is mutually exclusive with the Y-shape shared
            trunk (`shared_mlp_params`). Keys are forwarded to
            `CrossStitch` (`per_channel`, `init_diag`, `init_off`).
            Default `None` -> no cross-stitch.
        detach_gnn_input: bool, default False
            When True, stop-gradient on the niche path input: the
            tensor fed into the (optional) niche_neck + GNN is detached
            so spatial-loss gradients never reach the MLP trunk that
            also produces the cell-VQ input. On the COUPLED (shared-
            trunk) architecture this is the gradient-level coupling
            variant — one physical trunk, trained only by the cell
            objective, with the niche modules learning on top of the
            detached features. Works with any trunk mode.
        cell_to_niche: dict, optional
            Compositional cell->niche coupling. When set, the cell
            branch's representation is concatenated onto the niche GNN's
            node features, so the GNN aggregates neighbours' cell
            identity (local cell-type composition). Keys: `source`
            ('z_q_cell' [default] or 'z_mlp_cell'), `detach` (bool,
            default True — protect the cell branch from niche
            gradients), `project_dim` (int or None — optionally project
            the cell signal before concat). Default `None` -> no
            cell->niche injection.
        branch_adapter: dict, optional
            Parameter-efficient coupling: a small dim-preserving adapter
            per branch (cell adapter before VQ_cell, niche adapter before
            the GNN), so ONE shared trunk plus tiny per-branch
            specializers replace two full trunks. Each adapter inits to
            identity. Keys forwarded to `BranchAdapter`: `kind`
            ('affine' | 'lora' | 'mlp'), `rank` (lora), `hidden` (mlp).
            Typically used with the coupled trunk. Default `None` -> no
            adapters.
