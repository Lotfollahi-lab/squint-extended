"""
Define `Data` to refer to a PyG Data object that is constructed from a single batch of AnnData where each batch is a collection of cells originating from the same tissue section. Each `Data` object will have one or more of each type of the following attribute:
- `x_<feature_name>`: Node features (e.g.,cell-gene counts or neighborhood-gene counts)
- `y_<label_name>`: Node labels (e.g., cell types or niche types)
- `edge_index_<edge_index_name>`: Edge index (e.g., spatial neighbors via Delaunay triangulation or radius-based neighbors or k-nearest neighbors)
- `metadata_<metadata_name>`: Metadata (e.g., cell ids, batch ids, tissue, etc.)
We construct these attributes from the AnnData object stored as an `.h5ad` file on disk.

Next, define `Dataset` to refer to a PyG InMemoryDataset object comprising of collection of AnnData batches, i.e. `Data` objects. From an implementation perspective, we consider the Dataset to be a "blob" because we collate (combine) the individual Data objects (built previously from AnnData batches) into a single file called `dataset_blob.pt` before saving to disk. Currently, all Data objects in the Dataset have the same gene panel, meaning that the input feature dimensions are the same across all tissue sections.

For example, consider creating a DatasetBlob for `xhs1000-39b_1p` (Xenium Human Skin | id = 1000 | 39 batches | 1 gene panel). When we first process this data, we create 39 Data objects, each an attributed graph representation of the corresponding batch of cells, and save them all into `dataset_blob.pt`. When we load the DatasetBlob, we load the `dataset_blob.pt` file and then access the individual Data objects as needed.

Usage:
>>> dataset_blob = InMemoryDatasetBlob(name='xhs1000-39b_1p',
                                        label_names=['cell_types'],
                                        graph_kwargs={'delaunay': True},
                                        data_directory_path='/path/to/data',
                                        transform=transform)
>>> data = dataset[<batch-index>] # get a single Data object corresponding to a batch-index (say, 7)

Tradeoffs:
-------
- One dataset_blob.pt across all tissue sections in the experiment folder vs one data.pt per tissue section in the experiment folder.
- One dataset_blob.pt is easier to manage and load than multiple data.pt files. During training, we can load the entire dataset in one go and use one or more tissue sections per model as needed. This is useful because the subsequent subgraph sampling and batching can be done on the fly.
- For each epoch, we subset the dataset_blob by batch(es) and then sample subgraphs from the batch(es) for training. This is more time efficient than sampling subgraphs from each batch separately, but requires more memory.
- Memory usage is a concern because the entire dataset is loaded into memory at once. This is not a problem for small datasets but can be a bottleneck for large datasets.
- For larger datasets, we have two options:
    1. Create one dataset_blob.pt per batch of cells in the experiment folder. This is more memory efficient but increases time complexity because, if we have (say) T training epochs, each AnnData batch is loaded and removed from memory T times.
    2. Create an OnDiskDatasetBlob that loads parallely in chunks.
