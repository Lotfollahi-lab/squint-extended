"""
This class extends the Pytorch Lightning's LightningDataModule class to provide a more flexible way to create PyTorch Lightning DataModules that are compatible with PyTorch Geometric for our use case wherein we split the Pytorch Geometric GNN models into separate encoder and predictor submodules.
This has two main advantages:
1. We can inherit all the nice properties of the parent classes including `setup`, `prepare_data` and `infer train-val-test` nodes. These can also be overriden in the future if necessary.
2. We can define our custom train, validation, test, and inference dataloaders that are compatible with PyTorch Geometric's DataLoader and Sampler classes.

Initializing this class requires defining a Loader and a Sampler along with their corresponding parameters.

The `loader_name` argument is used to define the DataLoader class that will be used to load the data. Currently, we support the following:
- `FullLoader`: This option provides backwards compatibility with the default `LightningNodeData` class that uses the full graph for training.
- `DefaultNodeLoader`: This option provides backwards compatibility with the default `LightningNodeData` class that uses the default `NodeLoader` along with `NeighborSampler` from PyTorch Geometric.
- NeighborLoader: This option uses the `NeighborLoader` class from PyTorch Geometric. Ignores the loader and sampler related setup in the parent class.
The `loader_params` argument is a dictionary that can be used to define the arguments that will be passed to the DataLoader class. We mainly focus on `batch_size` for now.
Use `FullLoader` and `DefaultNodeLoader` only if the default `LightningNodeData` class is sufficient for your use case. Otherwise, define and use your own custom Loader and Sampler.

The `sampler_name` argument is used to define the Sampler class that will be used to sample the subgraphs. Currently, we support the following:
- `NeighborSampler`: This option uses the `NeighborSampler` class from PyTorch Geometric.
The `sampler_params` argument is a dictionary that can be used to define the arguments that will be passed to the Sampler class. We mainly focus on `num_neighbors` for now.

KEY INFO:
---> The Loader + Sampler combination is kept the same across training, validation and testing.
---> The input data to this class must be a single PyTorch Geometric Data object. If the experiment requires multiple tissue sections, the data must be concatenated before being passed to this class.
---> The `infer_dataloader` method is provided to allow for looping over all the nodes in the graph unlike the training, validation, and testing dataloaders which only loop over the nodes in the training, validation, and test sets respectively.
---> The `sample_neighbors_for_inference` parameter is used to control whether the neighbors are sampled during inference or not. This parameter is the same for validation and testing and is ignored for training.

        This function initializes the InMemoryDataModule class with the given DataLoader and Sampler classes along with their corresponding parameters.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        - data: Data
            A single PyTorch Geometric Data object that contains the graph data.
        - loader_name: Literal['DefaultFullLoader', 'DefaultNodeLoader', 'NeighborLoader']
            Name of the DataLoader class that will be used to load the data.
        - loader_params: Optional[dict]
            Dictionary that contains the arguments that will be passed to the DataLoader class, e.g. `batch_size`.
        - sampler_name: Optional[Literal['NeighborSampler']]
            Name of the Sampler class that will be used to sample the subgraphs.
        - sampler_params: Optional[dict]
            Dictionary that contains the arguments that will be passed to the Sampler class, e.g. `num_neighbors`.
        - sample_neighbors_for_inference: bool
            Whether to sample neighbors for the VALIDATION and TEST
            dataloaders. When False (legacy default), val/test fan out
            with `num_neighbors=[-1]` (every neighbor). When True, val/test
            re-use the training sampler's `num_neighbors` so the GPU
            stays fed during validation (the per-step cost matches
            training instead of being 10-100x heavier).
        - predict_sample_neighbors_for_inference: bool
            Independent toggle for the PREDICT dataloader. Default
            `False`: the final predict pass always fans out with
            `num_neighbors=[-1]` so the embeddings written to AnnData
            are deterministic and aggregate every neighbor — that's
            what downstream batch-integration metrics (iLISI, MMD)
            and clustering metrics (NMI, ARI) expect. Set to `True`
            only if you specifically want stochastic predict-time
            sampling (e.g. dropout-style uncertainty estimates).

            The split exists because val/test can legitimately want
            cheap sampling for training-loop throughput, while the
            single final predict pass should be heavy + deterministic.
            Setting `sample_neighbors_for_inference=True` alone (the
            common case) leaves predict on the safe default.
        - predict_batch_size: Optional[int]
            Per-batch size used by the PREDICT dataloader only. When
            None (legacy default), predict inherits the training
            `batch_size` from `loader_params`. The training batch size
            is tuned for adversarial gradient dynamics — predict has
            no such constraint and benefits from a much bigger batch
            (fewer kernel launches, better GPU SM utilisation).
            Combined with `predict_sample_neighbors_for_inference=False`
            (the full-fanout default), bumping this to 4-8x the
            training batch size typically cuts predict wall-clock 2-3x.
            Memory ceiling: bigger predict batches carry more sampled
            neighbours per batch ([-1] fanout × bigger seeds = bigger
            total node count). 1024 is known-safe on a 256 GiB GPU
            for the mmb-smb graph; bump to 2048+ on larger memory.
        - val_batch_size: Optional[int]
            Per-batch size used by the VAL and TEST dataloaders. When
            None (legacy default), val/test inherit the training
            `batch_size` from `loader_params`. Like predict, val and
            test are no-grad passes so the small training batch is
            unnecessary — bumping to 4-8x the training batch reduces
            the val-pass wall-clock at every val epoch, which directly
            lifts the GPU-utilisation floor (the GPU previously sat
            idle for several seconds per val pass as small val batches
            dribbled through). Combined with `check_val_every_n_epoch=2`
            in the trainer config, this is one of the cheapest
            throughput wins for SQUINT training. Safe to set
            independently from `predict_batch_size`; val typically
            uses the val-loader's own fanout (`sample_neighbors_for_inference`),
            which is lighter than predict's `[-1]` so val can usually
            go even bigger than predict.
        - cache_train_batches: bool
            When True, the TRAINING DataLoader pre-computes one full
            epoch's worth of `Batch` objects on first access and
            serves the same cached list every subsequent epoch. The
            standard NeighborLoader path (CPU NeighborSampler + induced
            subgraph construction + tensor copy) is the dominant CPU
            cost in SQUINT training; caching collapses it to a single
            up-front pass and turns every later epoch into a pure
            memcpy + H2D-copy loop. Per-epoch reshuffling of BATCH
            ORDER is preserved (the cached list is wrapped in a
            DataLoader with `shuffle=True`), but per-epoch neighbor
            resampling and per-epoch seed-to-batch regrouping are
            NOT — every epoch sees the same set of batches.

            IMPORTANT: when caching is on, the cache-build loader's
            `num_neighbors` is overridden to `[-1]` (full neighborhood)
            regardless of `sampler_params['num_neighbors']`. Rationale:
            the cache freezes neighborhoods anyway, so freezing the
            FULL per-cell neighborhood is strictly more informative
            than freezing a random subset — same staticness either
            way. `self.sampler_params` is NOT mutated; val/test/predict
            loaders still read the original fanout.

            Trade-off:
              + 30-60% wall-clock saving on CPU-sampler-heavy datasets
                (SQUINT-scale spatial graphs with fanout=[8]).
              + Lower CPU pressure → frees workers for other jobs on
                shared nodes.
              + Each cell sees its FULL spatial neighborhood every
                step (richer signal than the sampled-[8] fanout used
                by the uncached path).
              - Loss of per-epoch neighbor-resampling regularisation.
                For SQUINT this is usually small because the spatial
                k-NN graph is sparse (avg degree ~10-12) — the
                augmentation lost is small. A/B test on niche NMI /
                iLISI if you're worried.
              - Memory: stores ~N_train_batches × per-batch-node-tensors
                in CPU memory. With the full-fanout override, ~2-3 GB
                at SQUINT-mmb-smb scale (175 batches × ~12 neighbors ×
                256 seeds × 431 genes float32), more like ~5-15 GB on
                chl59-scale graphs. Still comfortable inside the
                128 GB LSF default for the mmb / smb panels; consider
                turning OFF on chl59 if you tighten memory limits.

            Defaults to False to preserve legacy behaviour; turn on
            via the base config or per-variant patches.

        - The PREDICT path consults `predict_sample_neighbors_for_inference`

          Default is `False` → fans out with `num_neighbors=[-1]` (every
          neighbor) so the embeddings written to AnnData are
          deterministic and aggregate the full neighborhood. Set the
          flag to `True` if you want stochastic predict-time sampling.
        - The PREDICT path can also use a separate `predict_batch_size`
          (set on the datamodule). Default is "inherit
          `loader_params['batch_size']`" — same as legacy. Bumping it
          (e.g. 1024 with a 256-train-batch run) reduces the total
          number of predict batches without changing model outputs;
          training-time batch_size is tuned for gradient dynamics and
          isn't relevant during a no-grad predict pass.
